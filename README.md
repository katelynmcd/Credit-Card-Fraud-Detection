# credit-card-fraud-detection
Machine learning project detecting credit card fraud using logistic regression and random forest models.

This project analyzes a large, highly imbalanced credit card transaction dataset and builds machine learning models to identify fraudulent transactions.  
Models used:
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest

**Files included:**
- `Fraud_Detection_Analysis.pdf` — Full written project report
- `fraud_detection.ipynb` — Google Colab notebook with all code

**Key Methods:**
- Z-score standardization  
- One-hot encoding  
- SMOTE for class imbalance  
- Model evaluation using Precision, Recall, F1, and ROC AUC  

**Top Model:**  Random Forest  
- Recall: 0.8762  
- Precision: 0.0701  
- AUC: 0.9647
